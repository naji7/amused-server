## Prompt

"Update the createProductService and products controller to handle optional image uploads with a default image URL if no file is provided, and make it TypeScript compatible."

## AI Response

- Modified `createProductService` to accept `file?: Express.MulterS3.File`.
- Set `imageUrl` to a default URL if `file` is undefined.
- Updated TypeScript types for Prisma compatibility.
- Updated `createProduct` controller to pass `req.file` as optional.
- Ensured code compiles with TypeScript and works with Jest tests.

## Human in the Loop

- Verified that `imageUrl` type matches Prisma model (`string`) and added a default image URL.
- Checked that optional file handling does not break existing tests.
- Confirmed `npm test` passes and low-stock event emission still works.
- Committed notes in `/ai-prompts/` with timestamp for traceability.
